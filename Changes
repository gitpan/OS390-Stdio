Special notes for release 0.004:
--------------------------------
The pds_mem() routine now does a better job of EXTENDing the 
perl XS ST-ack and ought to work with PDS'es that have more than
100 members.  It does not list ALIAS members as was noted
in testing (and documented in Stdio.pm).  A more extensive
test of pds_mem() has yet to be written.  All 70 tests ought to
pass for you though.

Special notes for release 0.001:
--------------------------------

None of the catalog/VTOC functions (vol_ser dsname_level) work

The pds_mem function is not yet operational.

rewind always seems to return undef.

mvswrite can cause trouble, *I do not recommend using it with
valuable data just yet*.

None of the vsam routines (locate update delrec) have been tested
at all.

the dsname key from the return value of get_dcb is not working.

make test fails these for me:

not ok 19
not ok 36
not ok 39
not ok 40
not ok 45
not ok 53
